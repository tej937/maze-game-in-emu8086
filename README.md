# maze-game-in-emu8086
A small maze game which is made in emu8086. 
The game is about solving and passing through the maze and and defusing the bomb in the end 
In this game a player moves from one point to another through the maze i.e. solves the maze and reaches the Bomb site. 
Once the player reaches bomb site he/she gets 3 chances to defuse it. 
For defusing a String In my code that String is "RGB"is compared with user entered String. 
if both string are same then bomb is defused else NOT DEFUSED TRY AGAIN is printed and 2nd chance is given
and still if string are not matched then MISSION FAILED BOMB HAS BEEN BLASTED is printed in the end. 
In the initial starting of the game a small timer of 60secs is given so if any player doesnot reach the bomb site before the timer then bomb explodes automatically
